# Hot Air Balloon Simulation Prototype

## Concept

This is a hot air balloon simulation game that allows the player to pilot their very own balloon across a mountainous landscape by altering the balloonâ€™s height, movement, and rotation via a cockpit joystick and ignition controls.

The environment contains a number of different platforms that the player can launch their hot air balloon from, and the player can dock at these platforms as well. Each platform offers different scenic views of the handcrafted environment, full of mountains and valleys, as well as different biomes (snow, grass, rock, etc.). 

Adding to the scenic views are a number of different sound effects.

Ultimately, the desired feeling this project is intended to give is that of freedom. I hope you enjoy it!
